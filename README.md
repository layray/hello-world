# hello-world
This is my first repo while trying to understand how github works

Hello people,
I am trying to understand what I can do with a branch. Also, I will try to commit the changes I have made which is similar to saving the changes I have made. I believe this is a very interesting exercise.

Cheers!


Trying to see it I can commit another thing to this branch
